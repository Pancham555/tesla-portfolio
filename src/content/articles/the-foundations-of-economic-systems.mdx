An economic system is the organizational structure a society uses to allocate its resources and distribute its goods and services. Fundamentally, every system must answer three core questions: **what** to produce, **how** to produce it, and **for whom** to produce it.

The traditional system, based on customs and historical precedent, is rarely seen in its pure form today. Modern economies generally fall into three broad categories. The **Market Economy**, often called **Capitalism**, is characterized by private ownership of resources and production means. Decisions about investment, production, and distribution are guided by the forces of **supply and demand** and the pursuit of profit, with minimal government intervention. The key mechanism is the price system, which signals scarcity and value across all sectors.

In contrast, the **Command Economy**, or **Communism**, features centralized control where the government or a central authority owns and directs all factors of production. Decisions on what, how, and for whom to produce are made via detailed central planning, theoretically aiming for equitable distribution and societal goals rather than individual profit. Historically, these systems have struggled with inefficiencies and resource misallocation due to the sheer complexity of central planning.

Most nations today operate under a **Mixed Economy**, which incorporates elements of both market and command systems. This is the predominant structure worldwide, where private enterprise drives most economic activity, but the government intervenes to regulate markets, provide public goods like infrastructure and defense, enforce property rights, and implement social safety nets. The degree of government involvement varies significantly, defining the distinct economic character of each nation.
